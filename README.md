# PicklePro thesis prototype

PicklePro analyzes fixed-camera pickleball footage and reports player detections, court positions, and a dwell-time heatmap with coverage and provenance. Rally segmentation, shot classification, skill, and play-style estimates are not implemented. The old dashboard is only a labelled sample-data design preview in development.

The application has two paths: **Sessions** uses Supabase email/password sign-in, private resumable uploads, queued analysis, and saved results; the **local prototype** sends a video directly to FastAPI without saving it. The hosted Sessions path still needs an end-to-end test against a dedicated Supabase project.

## Start locally

Use Node.js and Python 3.10 or newer. From `Pickleball Performance Dashboard/`:

```sh
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`. With the example environment file unchanged, it shows a setup screen. For Sessions, set the public Supabase URL and key in `.env.local` after following [Supabase setup](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md). Never put a service-role key in a `VITE_` variable.

For the local prototype, start the API in a second terminal:

```sh
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/#/local-prototype`. This development route is unavailable in production builds unless explicitly enabled. The API allows the local Vite origin by default.

## Synthetic CLI example

Run the CLI from `Pickleball Performance Dashboard/server/`:

```sh
mkdir -p ../local_media
.venv/bin/python -m picklepro.cli make-synthetic ../local_media/demo.mp4 --calibration-out ../local_media/demo_calibration.json
.venv/bin/python -m picklepro.cli analyze ../local_media/demo.mp4 --calibration ../local_media/demo_calibration.json --court-half near --out ../local_media/result.json
```

The clip and result are **synthetic test material**. The generator tries H.264 for browser playback and falls back to `mp4v` if H.264 encoding is unavailable. See [CV pipeline](docs/CV_PIPELINE.md) for calibration, output meaning, and limitations.

## Verify

From `Pickleball Performance Dashboard/`:

```sh
npm run check
cd server
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

From the repository root, `bash supabase/tests/run_local_rls_tests.sh` runs the database policy and job tests against a temporary local PostgreSQL instance. It needs PostgreSQL command-line tools. This harness does not include the hosted Supabase Auth, Storage, or TUS services.

Read [adviser decisions](docs/ADVISER_DECISIONS.md) before presenting proposed thesis features as delivered. The code does not copy `kpp91302/Pickleball-Analytics`, and the optional YOLO dependency has separate licensing implications.
